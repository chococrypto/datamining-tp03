# datamining-tp03
In this repository, we will practice our skills of independent and by now (fairly) experienced data analyst.

We will work with two new algorithms: 
  * We will implement on our own Naive Bayes classifier.
  * We will use the scikit-learn implementation of the logistic regression and use the official documentation together with any other information we can find (for example google) to understand how to use it.

We will reuse our work from [datamining-tp02](https://github.com/abousedas/datamining-tp02) on the full supervised learning pipeline to train, pick and evaluate our models.
